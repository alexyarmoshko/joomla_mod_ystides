# Yak Shaver Tides Joomla module

This Joomla 5 module shows tide predictions for a selected tidal station on the Irish coast.

The times are shown in UTC. In Ireland, from the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October, add one hour to convert to Irish Summer Time (IST).

Tide prediction data is retrieved from the Marine Institute [ERDDAP API](https://erddap.marine.ie/erddap/index.html) service.

Moon phase data is retrieved from the [U.S. Navy Astronomical Applications API](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/api) service.

The tidal coefficient indicates the forecast tidal range (amplitude) compared with the average equinoctial spring-tide range at Dublin Port (3.5 m).

A low coefficient indicates a smaller tidal range, while a high coefficient indicates a larger tidal range. The coefficient ranges from 20 (lowest neap tides) to 120 (extraordinary spring tides).
